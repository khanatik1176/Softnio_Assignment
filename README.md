RESTAURANT LANDING PAGE

Technologies: REACT.JS, Tailwind CSS
Pre-build components are used from Daisy UI.
React Slick has been used to develop the food item slider.
The form is functional and I have implemented basic error validation.

I have tested the responsiveness on the Microsoft Edge browser (iPhone XR, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro max, Google Pixel 2, iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad Pro).
